<h1>Business Web Project</h1>

<h3>This project consists of a website that was developed by me. It contains the data of a company, such as its departments and its employees.
In this project, there is a page for departments where it is possible to create new departments, edit existing ones, and even remove them.
There is also a specific page for employees, where it is possible to add, edit, and remove them.
All this data is stored in the MySQL database, which was the database I chose for this application. </h3>
